Omniverse DLT is derived from [Dante Network](https://github.com/dantenetwork). The Omniverse DLT is a new **application-level** token protocol built **over** multiple existing L1 public chains, enabling asset-related operations such as transfers and receptions running **over** different consensus spaces **synchronously and equivalently**.  

The core meaning of **Omniverse** is that ***The legitimacy of all on-chain states and operations can be equivalently verified and recorded simultaneously over different consensus spaces, regardless of where they were initiated.***  

O-DLT works at an **application level**, which means everything related is processed in **smart contracts** or **pallets**. **Nothing** relates to the native transactions of a single chain.
