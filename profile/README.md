The Omniverse DLT is a new **application-level** token protocol built upon multiple existing L1 public chains, enabling asset-related operations such as transfers and receptions running globally **over** different consensus spaces **synchronously and equivalently**.  

O-DLT could be considered as a decentralized global ledger established upon two parts:
- **Abstract Nodes** are smart contracts or similar mechanisms running at the application level over existing blockchains. The states recorded by the Abstract Nodes that are deployed on different blockchains respectively could be considered as copies of the global state, and they are ultimately consistent.
- **Synchronizer** is an off-chain procedure responsible for carrying published omniverse transactions from the O-DLT smart contracts on one blockchain to the O-DLT smart contracts of the others. They are absolutely trustless and without consensus.

The core meaning of **Omniverse** is that ***The legitimacy of all on-chain states and operations can be equivalently verified and recorded simultaneously over different consensus spaces, regardless of where they were initiated.*** This could be implemented by Verifiable Fraud Proof and ZK-Synchronization. 

O-DLT works at an **application** level, which means everything related is implemented by `smart contracts` or similar mechanisms like Substrate `Pallets`, rather than the native transactions of a single chain.     

The `Ordinals` mechanism on `BTC` has been supported recently.
